Host Enumeration is key!

You can use this tool to get a better understanding of the machine you're currently on. Can easily be ran within Cobalt Strike using the execute-assembly comnmand.

Currently this looks at: 
- IE Typed URLs
- Running processes (Checking for AV and VM processes)
- LAPS Settings
- Check if running as admin
- Hostname, IP, MAC
- Trusted Documents
- Windows Defender Exclusions

Working on: 
- Querying McAfee Registry Values
- Better functionality
- Maybe an option to export into a CSV?
